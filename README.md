We have developed a novel methodology for the analysis of plasma samples collected from colorectal (CRC) patients postoperatively and collect serial samples from the IMPROVE clinical trial (NCT03748680). For tumor-informed analysis, whole-exome sequencing data are generated from resected tumor tissues and matching peripheral blood mononuclear cells before surgery. After surgery, a targeted panel of 12,500 bp based on a 12-gene panel and 100 known CRC mutations is sequenced and labeled using unique molecular identifiers. The analysis matrices are of size five (A, C, G, T, and - for deletion) by 18,094, which accounts for a five basepairs distribution around each mutation. Here, we present a technical evaluation of the sensitivity and specificity of our method to correctly detect variants of the CRC mutations based on different amounts of input DNA and read coverage.
